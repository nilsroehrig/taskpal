# Taskpal

This is the companion repository for my workshop "Full-Stack Development with Svelte & SvelteKit (CF Edition)".

## Developing

```bash
# install dependencies
npm ci

# start dev server
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

## Deployment

```bash
# deploy to Cloudflare
npm run deploy
```
